To this end, V2 can report loca- tion closer to V1, lower speed, negative longitudinal acceleration, or their combination.\n",
    "** Lane Change Scenario. A vehicle (V2) can make another vehicle (V1) abort changing lane by causing the misconception that V2 is in a colliding course with V1 (Figure 2(b)). To this end, V2 can report false location, higher speed, and higher acceleration. Alter- natively, V1 could make V2 brake by reporting that it is changing lane while actually going straight forward.\n",
